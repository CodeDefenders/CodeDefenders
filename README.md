# Code Defenders

This is Code Defenders, a mutation testing game.

## Requirements

- Tomcat Server v7 or later
- Ant (default executable `/usr/local/bin/ant`, set environment variable `ANT_HOME`)
- Maven
- MySQL

## Database

To create the database, execute `src/main/resources/db/codedefenders.sql`:

```bash
mysql -u [username] -p
> source src/main/resources/db/codedefenders.sql;
```

## Data Storage

Classes, tests and mutants are stored in `/var/lib/codedefenders/`, these directories must exist:

```bash
mkdir -p /var/lib/codedefenders/sources /var/lib/codedefenders/tests /var/lib/codedefenders/mutants
```

The tomcat user (and possibly the user running Code Defenders) must have full permissions on this directory.

Major and Evosuite must be stored in their respective folders within this directory (codedefenders/major and codedefenders/evosuite).

## Deployment

### Tomcat admin user

Add manager-script role and user to `$CATALINA_HOME/conf/tomcat-users.xml` (`$CATALINA_HOME` should be set to your Tomcat installation root directory):

```xml
<role rolename="manager-script"/>  
<user username="adminscript" password="adm3b5eM3JG" roles="manager-script"/>  
```
  
### Deploy first time

Tomcat and MySQL passwords must be provided to compile and deploy _the first time_, either by editing `makefile` or by passing them as arguments:

```bash
make first [TOMCAT_PASSWORD=... MYSQL_PASSWORD=...]
```
### Redeploy

To compile and _redeploy_:

```bash
make
```

## IntelliJ Project

- Import Maven project from existing sources
- Configure Tomcat server
  - Preferences -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Application Servers -> Add Tomcat Server

- Add Run/Debug Configuration
  - Run -> Edit Configurations... -> Add New Tomcat Server configuration -> Add \`Build artifact\` in \`Before launch\` panel and check On Update action: Redeploy. -> OK
