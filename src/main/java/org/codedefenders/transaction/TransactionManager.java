/**
 * A {@link TransactionManager} is a class which provides a standard way to run multiple database query executed in a
 * Thread in the same transaction and decide if the changes should actually be saved to the database (via a 'commit')
 * or discarded (via a 'rollback').
 *
 * <p>SQL statements will be—if no other transaction isolation level is given—executed with the default isolation level
 * of the database/JDBC driver.
 *
 * <p>Nested transactions are realized via savepoint.
 *
 * <p>This interface provides two methods:
 * {@link #startTransaction()} and {@link #executeInTransaction(TransactionalSupplier)}
 *
 * <p>In most cases {@link #executeInTransaction(TransactionalSupplier)} should be used instead of
 * {@link #startTransaction()}.<br>
 * The only advantage the later one provides, is the ability to spread the start and the end (either 'commit' or
 * 'rollback') over multiple methods. This is strongly discouraged, because it will be very hard to ensure every started
 * {@link Transaction} (and the underlying {@link java.sql.Connection}) is closed.
